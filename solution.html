          <h1>How to Help Mitigate the Negative Effects of AI</h1>
          <p>The issues presented by the development of AI are frightening. What can you, and society in general, do to help ensure that AI is used to benefit the world rather than harm it?</p>

          <h2>Stay Informed</h2>
          <p>Staying informed, both about artificial intelligence and other news, is one of the best ways to reduce the negative effects of AI. This doesn't just mean looking at the news frequently; it's also becoming increasingly important to be able to identify misinformation.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn the basics about how AI works. Don't worry - you don't need to be a genius to understand the basics of artificial intelligence. HubSpot has a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-does-ai-work" target="_blank">blog post</a> about the basics of AI and there are numerous free resources from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-ai" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained" target="_blank">MIT</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-ai-quick-start-guide-for-beginners" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>, and other websites to learn about AI. If you find that you enjoy working with AI, you may even choose to pursue a career in it; the best way to avoid being affected by job loss caused by AI is to learn how to work with AI.</li>
            <li>Get your news from credible news websites when possible. When in doubt, use fact-check websites such as <a href="https://www.snopes.com/" target="_blank">Snopes</a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/" target="_blank">FactCheck.org</a>. Keep in mind that social media algorithms (which are powered by AI) are likely to show you content that supports your beliefs, so fact checking is particularly important when you see something on social media.</li>

          <h2>Use AI Responsibly</h2>
          <p>Artificial intelligence can be helpful but it can also be harmful. Make sure you consider the consequences of your actions when using AI.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't use generative AI in environments where it isn't permitted. This includes most academic institutions.</li>
            <li>Be careful of misinformation when using artificial intelligence. Don't assume that all information provided by AI (whether it's through social media feeds or through ChatGPT) is truth and definitely don't use it to share misleading images and videos.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The "EVERY" acronym can be used to ensure that you use AI responsibly. See the infographic shown <span class="large-screen">on the left</span><span class="small-screen">below</span>.</p>

          <h2>AI Regulation</h2>
          <p>Governments around the world are looking to implement legislation to regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence. The European Union's <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">AI Act</a> is among the more comprehensive regulations that will be implemented and it looks to implement the following rules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI systems that are classified as having an "unacceptable risk" will be banned. This includes AI that manipulates the behaviour of people (e.g., toys that encourage dangerous behaviour in children) and classifying people based on behaviour or personal characteristics.</li>
            <li>"High risk" AI systems will be assessed before being put on the market and throughout their lifecycle.</li>
            <li>Generative AI will need to disclose that the content was generated by AI, prevent itself from generating illegal content, and provide summaries of all copyrighted data used for training the AI model.</li>
            <li>"Limited risk" AI systems will need to inform the user that they're interacting with AI and comply with transparency requirements that help users make informed decisions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The image shown <span class="large-screen">on the right</span><span class="small-screen">below</span> has a summary of the levels of risk in the EU's AI act.</p>
          <p>Regulations like these can help ensure that AI is used and developed responsibly.</p>
