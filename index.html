          <div class="hero-subtitle">Lucas Kim - ICS4U1 - December 5, 2023</div>
          <p>You've likely heard about AI, also known as artificial intelligence, at some point. It's been all over the news for years, and even more so over the past year because of new AI-powered services such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. Two questions that many people, including governments all around the world, are asking are: what are the implications of AI and how can we mitigate its negative effects?</p>

          <h2>What is AI?</h2>
          <p>AI is the ability of a computer to perform seemingly intelligent things. The word "intelligent" can mean many things, but in the context of artificial intelligence, it typically refers to problem solving, learning, perception, reasoning, and using language. Examples of applications for AI include virtual assistants (like Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), social media feed recommendations, self-driving vehicles, chatbots (such as ChatGPT), and facial recognition.</p>

          <h2>Why are we worrying about AI now?</h2>
          <p>For years, fears of AI harming the world were mostly limited to science fiction films and books. Why are governments and experts around the world suddenly rushing to control the development of AI?</p>
          <p>The primary reason for this is that AI has advanced significantly in the past few years and has entered the mainstream. ChatGPT took the world by storm, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/" target="_blank">reaching 100 million monthly active users in just 2 months</a>, and AI-powered services such as Midjourney have also massively increased in popularity. The below image shows the progression of AI-generated faces since 2014:</p>

        <p>As the capabilities of AI have increased, so have its ability to be used for harmful reasons. Incidents and controversies related to artificial intelligence have increased exponentially over the past few years, with recent notable examples being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/02/tom-hanks-dental-ad-ai-version-fake" target="_blank">Tom Hanks deepfake being used for a dental plan ad</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/" target="_blank">AI art generators seemingly perpetuating stereotypes</a>.</p>

        <h2>Concerns About AI</h2>
        <p>Creating intelligent technology may seem like a good thing, but there are several valid concerns about the effects of AI. Just this past March, over 1,000 technology leaders, researchers, and other AI experts <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/alarmed-tech-leaders-call-ai-research-pause">signed an open letter</a> emphasizing AI's "profound risks to society and humanity" and calling for a pause on AI development.</p>
        <p>There are numerous concerns about AI, but here are some of the most significant ones:</p>

        <!-- A "concern container" - includes the button and the content. This is for unemployment. -->
        <div class="concern-container">
          <!-- The "concern title" - the button to expand/collapse the section -->

            <h3 class="concern-heading">Unemployment</h3>
            <span class="concern-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <!-- The "concern description" - the actual content about the concern, which is hidden by default -->
          <div class="concern-description">
            <p>There are worries that AI could develop to the point where it's able to replace human workers. In fact, many believe that Large Language Models (LLMs), which are used in various technologies such as LLMs, can already be used to replace translators, human assistants, and paralegals.</p>
            <p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130" target="_blank">paper written by OpenAI researchers</a> declared that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 1/10th of their work tasks affected by LLMs, while about 19% of the workforce could have at least half their tasks affected. The paper also states that around 15% of work tasks could be completed significantly faster while maintaining the same quality by using LLMs instead of human labour.</p>
            <p>The following excerpt (2:51 to 4:06) from a video by TED-Ed briefly explains the idea of "technological unemployment."</p>

        <!-- Concern 2: Disinformation -->
        <div class="concern-container">
          <div class="concern-title">
            <h3 class="concern-heading">Disinformation</h3>
            <span class="concern-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="concern-description">
            <p>Social media platforms, which have feeds powered by artificial intelligence, are prime locations for disinformation. The objective of the feeds is to maximize user engagement because more engagement results in more ads and more ads result in more money. Often, the most appealing content to the user is content that they're interested in or that they agree with. This creates what is known as "echo chambers": an environment that only consists of ideas that the user agrees with, which is supported using information that may or may not be factual. As a result, disinformation and polarization becomes commonplace.</p>
            <p>In addition, AI can create new disinformation. One well-known behaviour of ChatGPT and other similar chatbots is <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/ai-hallucinations/">"hallucinating,"</a> where the AI model generates incorrect information but presents it like a fact. This isn't just limited to real-world facts - this also occurs with knowledge-based problems, even with math which computers are typically good at. OpenAI measured the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">a variety of exams</a>, and they both performed below the 50th percentile on several of them. While you may be able to have a decent amount of confidence in ChatGPT's solution to an AP Environmental Science problem, asking it for the solution to a math contest problem (such as from AMC 10 or AMC 12) may not be the best idea.</p>

            <p>In addition, generative AI is capable of quickly generating massive amounts of content, which can be used to spread misinformation rapidly. This disinformation isn't just limited to text; deepfakes and AI-generated images are becoming increasingly hard to distinguish from real photos and videos. Even an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/arts/music/ai-drake-the-weeknd-fake.html" target="_blank">AI-generated Drake and the Weeknd song went viral on social media</a> earlier this year.</p>

            <h3 class="concern-heading">Sourcing Training Data</h3>
            <span class="concern-toggle">+</span>
          </div>
          <div class="concern-description">
            <p>Machine learning models require massive amounts of data to be trained. The sourcing of this data, particularly for AI image generators such as Midjourney and DALL-E, is controversial. The data is often found via web scraping and taken without consent from the authors or artists. The people who develop these generative AI models argue that the use of these images is covered in the US by <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">fair use</a>, which allows for the use of copyrighted work in some cases. One of the factors when deciding whether something is fair use is whether it threatens the livelihood of the original creator by competing with their original works; asking Midjourney to generate an image in the style of a particular artist arguably violates this part of fair use.</p>
            <p>In addition, some argue that since AI is powered by algorithms and code, it's closer to a mindless bot that basically copies things from its training data rather than something that creates novel text or images. Others would make the counterargument that humans are similar: just a collection of neurons that work together to produce something that we call intelligence. It's a complex topic that has strong arguments for both sides.</p>
            <p>Here is a graph from Our World in Data that shows the number of data points required to train artificial intelligence systems. As you can see, complex AI systems need billions or even trillions of data points to be trained, which is why they depend so heavily on scraping data without permission; it would be infeasible to license all the data that it uses.</p>

          <div class="concern-description">
            <p>AI systems collect tons of data from users because it maximizes its efficiency. For example, Facebook ads (and ads on most social media platforms) are extremely effective because they collect tons of data which is then fed to the AI system to recommend the best ads for each user. The German online retailer Otto reduced its cost per click (money spent on ads divided by the number of clicks on the ad) by 38% using highly targeted ads. The benefits of collecting data from users isn't just limited to social media: for example, a personal assistant will be more helpful if it has access to most of its user's information and self-driving vehicles can be massively improved by collecting telemetry data from its users' cars.</p>
            <p>Privacy is one of the issues with AI that worries consumers the most. A survey of over 3,600 US consumers found that 41% of consumers rank protecting personal information as their #1 concern with AI.</p>
